			<p class="character">Aegeon</p>
			<p class="verseline">Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And by the doom of death end woes and all.</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am not partial to infringe our laws.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The enmity and discord which of late</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.</p>
			<p class="verseline">For, since the mortal and intestine jars</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</p>
			<p class="verseline">It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Again, if any Syracusian born</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,</p>
			<p class="verseline">His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unless a thousand marks be levied,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.</p>
			<p class="character">Aegeon</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why thou departed’st from thy native home,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</p>
			<p class="character">Aegeon</p>
			<p class="verseline">A heavier task could not have been impos’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet, that the world may witness that my end</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</p>
			<p class="verseline">In Syracuse was I born, and wed</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And by me, had not our hap been bad.</p>
			<p class="verseline">With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">By prosperous voyages I often made</p>
			<p class="verseline">To Epidamnum; till my factor’s death,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And the great care of goods at random left,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</p>
			<p class="verseline">From whom my absence was not six months old,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Before herself, almost at fainting under</p>
			<p class="verseline">The pleasing punishment that women bear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Had made provision for her following me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And soon and safe arrived where I was.</p>
			<p class="verseline">There had she not been long but she became</p>
			<p class="verseline">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, which was strange, the one so like the other</p>
			<p class="verseline">As could not be disdnguish’d but by names.</p>
			<p class="verseline">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A mean woman was delivered</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</p>
			<p class="verseline">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Made daily motions for our home return;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon</p>
			<p class="verseline">We came aboard.</p>
			<p class="verseline">A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Before the always-wind-obeying deep</p>
			<p class="verseline">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</p>
			<p class="verseline">But longer did we not retain much hope,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</p>
			<p class="verseline">A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.</p>
			<p class="verseline">And this it was, for other means was none:</p>
			<p class="verseline">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;</p>
			<p class="verseline">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</p>
			<p class="verseline">To him one of the other twins was bound,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</p>
			<p class="verseline">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dispers’d those vapours that offended us;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, by the benefit of his wished light,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</p>
			<p class="verseline">Two ships from far making amain to us-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</p>
			<p class="verseline">But ere they came-O, let me say no more!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Gather the sequel by that went before.</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</p>
			<p class="character">Aegeon</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</p>
			<p class="verseline">Worthily term’d them merciless to us!</p>
			<p class="verseline">For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</p>
			<p class="verseline">We were encount’red by a mighty rock,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which being violently borne upon,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</p>
			<p class="verseline">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fortune had left to both of us alike</p>
			<p class="verseline">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened</p>
			<p class="verseline">With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was carried with more speed before the wind;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in our sight they three were taken up</p>
			<p class="verseline">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</p>
			<p class="verseline">At length another ship had seiz’d on us;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck’d guests,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do me the favour to dilate at full</p>
			<p class="verseline">What have befall’n of them and thee till now.</p>
			<p class="character">Aegeon</p>
			<p class="verseline">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</p>
			<p class="verseline">At eighteen years became inquisitive</p>
			<p class="verseline">After his brother, and importun’d me</p>
			<p class="verseline">That his attendant-so his case was like,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Might bear him company in the quest of him;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or that or any place that harbours men.</p>
			<p class="verseline">But here must end the story of my life;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And happy were I in my timely death,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Could all my travels warrant me they live.</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My soul should sue as advocate for thee.</p>
			<p class="verseline">But though thou art adjudged to the death,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And passed sentence may not be recall’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">But to our honour’s great disparagement,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet will I favour thee in what I can.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</p>
			<p class="verseline">To seek thy help by beneficial hap.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.</p>

			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Let’s hear it.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</p>

			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">For what reason?</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">For two; and sound ones too.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, not sound I pray you.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>

			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Certain ones, then.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Name them.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his</p>
			<p class="prose">porridge.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">You would all this time have prov’d there is no time for all things.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature.</p>
			<p class="character">Antipholus Of Syracuse</p>
			<p class="prose">But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Syracuse</p>

			<p class="verseline">That I this day of him receiv’d the chain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which</p>
			<p class="verseline">He did arrest me with an officer.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I did obey, and sent my peasant home</p>
			<p class="verseline">For certain ducats; he with none return’d.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then fairly I bespoke the officer</p>
			<p class="verseline">To go in person with me to my house.</p>
			<p class="verseline">By th’ way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of vile confederates. Along with them</p>
			<p class="verseline">They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac’d villain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A living dead man. This pernicious slave,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And with no face, as ‘twere, outfacing me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Cries out I was possess’d. Then all together</p>
			<p class="verseline">They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in a dark and dankish vault at home</p>
			<p class="verseline">There left me and my man, both bound together;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I gain’d my freedom, and immediately</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech</p>
			<p class="verseline">To give me ample satisfaction</p>
			<p class="verseline">For these deep shames and great indignities.</p>
			<p class="character">Angelo</p>
			<p class="verseline">My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,</p>

			<p class="character">Angelo</p>
			<p class="verseline">He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,</p>
			<p class="verseline">These people saw the chain about his neck.</p>

			<p class="verseline">Heard you confess you had the chain of him,</p>

			<p class="verseline">If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.</p>

			<p class="verseline">Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</p>
			<p class="character">Dromio Of Ephesus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, he din’d with her there, at the Porpentine.</p>
