<p class="first">Shakespeare play, Comedy of errors is a typical example of Shakespearean slapstick comedy. It narrates the comical drama of mistaken identities involving two sets of identical twins separated since birth. Both Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant Dromio have corresponding twins in the likeness of brothers with the same names residing in the city of Ephesus where incidentally syracusans arenâ€™t allowed and the penalty is death.</p>
<p>Comedy of errors unfolds over a series of hilarious events involving wrongful accusations, seductions, beatings and even the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus under the charge of infidelity, thievery and insanity. The play ends on a happy note with both twins united.</p>
